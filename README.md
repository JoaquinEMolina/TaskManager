# Final Project CS50W ‚Äì Capstone

## Tasks Manager

### üìù Overview

**Tasks Manager** is a dynamic Single Page Application (SPA) developed as the final project for the CS50W: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. This project provides users with an efficient and collaborative environment to manage tasks and projects, track deadlines, and distribute responsibilities across teams.

The application was designed to address common challenges in team-based task management for small teams or individuals, offering a simple yet powerful interface. Users can create tasks, assign them to multiple collaborators, categorize them under projects, and use real-time filtering to navigate large volumes of data seamlessly.

This project emphasizes user experience, responsiveness, and logical data structure ‚Äî enabling the user to view only the relevant information based on their role or assignments.

### üö© Distinctiveness and Complexity

This project is significantly different from the others in the course and meets the complexity requirement for the following reasons:

- It is **not a social network**, an **e-commerce site**, or a **clone** of previous projects.
- The **architecture** is unique, with a custom relational model involving multiple related entities (Task, Project, User, Comment).
- Implements a **dynamic SPA** with real-time filtering, client-side rendering, modal-based CRUD, and fade transitions.
- Supports **role-based behavior**, where only creators or assigned users can edit, close, or delete tasks or projects.
- The interface is **fully responsive** and optimized for mobile use.

#### Features that increase complexity:

- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** is used for building the backend API (serializers, viewsets, filtering), but **not for authentication**‚Äîstandard Django views handle login/logout/registration.
- **Choices.js** is used to enhance multi-select fields for assigning users and filtering by status.
- **Flatpickr** is used for intuitive and correctly formatted date inputs.
- **Real-time dynamic filters** allow users to filter by title, project, user, and status without reloading.
- The system is **designed for extensibility**, making it easy to add dashboards, analytics, CSV export, or subtasks.
- **Permissions logic**: enforced both on the frontend (buttons hidden) and backend (server rejects unauthorized edits/deletions).

This goes beyond course requirements by blending Django with a modular JavaScript frontend and DRF-powered backend.


This combination of custom architecture, SPA behavior, external integrations, and advanced Django usage ensures the project is both distinctive and complex.
