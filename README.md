# Final Project CS50W ‚Äì Capstone

## Tasks Manager

### üìù Overview

**Tasks Manager** is a dynamic SPA (Single Page Application) built as the final project for the CS50W course. It provides users with a tool to manage tasks and projects collaboratively, offering a modern and interactive interface. Users can create tasks, assign multiple users, group them by projects, and apply dynamic filters in real-time. This tool is intended for personal use and small teams.

### üö© Distinctiveness and Complexity

This project is significantly different from the others in the course and meets the complexity requirement for the following reasons:

- It is **not a social network**, an **e-commerce site**, or a **clone** of previous projects.
- The **architecture** is unique, with a custom relational model involving multiple related entities (Task, Project, User, Comment).
- Implements a **dynamic SPA** with real-time filtering, client-side rendering, modal-based CRUD, and fade transitions.
- Supports **role-based behavior**, where only creators or assigned users can edit, close, or delete tasks or projects.
- The interface is **fully responsive** and optimized for mobile use.

#### Features that increase complexity:

- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** is used for building the backend API (serializers, viewsets, filtering), but **not for authentication**‚Äîstandard Django views handle login/logout/registration.
- **Choices.js** is used to enhance multi-select fields for assigning users and filtering by status.
- **Flatpickr** is used for intuitive and correctly formatted date inputs.
- **Real-time dynamic filters** allow users to filter by title, project, user, and status without reloading.
- The system is **designed for extensibility**, making it easy to add dashboards, analytics, CSV export, or subtasks.

This goes beyond course requirements by blending Django with a modular JavaScript frontend and DRF-powered backend.


This combination of custom architecture, SPA behavior, external integrations, and advanced Django usage ensures the project is both distinctive and complex.
